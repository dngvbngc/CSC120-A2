Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked: 
- Looking through procedural_resale_shop.py, computer.py and main.py carefully to identify the necessary attributes and methods of computer and resale shop
- Reusing code from these 2 given files when possible 
- Googling any python syntax that is new to me
- Writing a new main file to test my code

What didn't work:
- Looking at main.py before looking at procedural_resale_shop.py and computer.py

Advice for later students:
- Examine procedural_resale_shop.py and computer.py before main.py
- Look through the tasks, identify the corresponding objects, and note the task down as comments in their specific object's files before coding
